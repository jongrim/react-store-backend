# React Store Backend
This repository holds the code for the backend of my [React Store application](https://github.com/jongrim/react-store). Because React Store is a React app, the frontend is isolated from the backend, and the backend functions as a REST API.

## Technology Stack
The backend is built and tested with the following technologies:

- Node
- Express
- MySQL and Sequelize
- Mocha / Chai / Supertest
